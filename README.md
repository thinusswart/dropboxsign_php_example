# Dropbox Sign PHP SDK Example

This example code is for an article I wrote for interfacing with the Dropbox Sign API using the official [PHP SDK](https://github.com/hellosign/dropbox-sign-php).

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed
* A [Dropbox Sign](https://www.dropbox.com/hellosign) Account

## Usage

Clone the repository, then run `composer install` in the project directory

Replace any placeholder values (like `<API_KEY_HERE>`) and run the commands from the command line:

```shell
php getTemplates.php
```

## Further Reading

For more information, consult the official [API documentation](https://developers.hellosign.com).
